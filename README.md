# Watson Co-Scientist

An AI system that assists scientists in generating, refining, and testing research hypotheses. This system serves as a collaborative partner, enhancing scientists' ability to explore complex scientific problems efficiently through multi-database scientific knowledge integration.

## Overview

The co-scientist is designed to act as a helpful assistant and collaborator to scientists, helping to accelerate the scientific discovery process. The system is a compound, multi-agent AI system built on large language models, designed to mirror the reasoning process underpinning the scientific method.

Given a research goal specified in natural language, the system can:
- Generate novel, original research hypotheses using knowledge from multiple scientific databases
- Propose experimental protocols for downstream validations
- Provide rigorous verification of hypotheses through causal reasoning and computational simulation
- Identify specific, testable predictions and potential failure modes
- Provide grounding for recommendations by citing relevant literature from multiple sources
- Explain the reasoning behind proposals with probabilistic assessment
- Synthesize knowledge across scientific domains to promote interdisciplinary discovery

## System Architecture

The system employs a multi-agent architecture integrated within an asynchronous task execution framework:

1. **Supervisor Agent**: Coordinates the work of specialized agents and manages system resources
2. **Generation Agent**: Generates novel research hypotheses and research proposals
3. **Reflection Agent**: Performs multiple types of reviews, including:
   - Standard reviews for correctness, quality, novelty, and ethics
   - Deep verification reviews with causal reasoning and probabilistic assessment
   - Simulation reviews with computational modeling and prediction testing
   - Observation reviews linking hypotheses to existing experimental evidence
   - Protocol reviews assessing the feasibility and rigor of experimental designs
4. **Ranking Agent**: Conducts tournaments to rank hypotheses via scientific debates
5. **Proximity Agent**: Calculates similarity between hypotheses to organize the hypothesis space
6. **Evolution Agent**: Improves existing hypotheses through various strategies
7. **Meta-Review Agent**: Synthesizes insights from reviews and tournaments into a comprehensive research overview, including causal reasoning patterns and verification recommendations

## Features

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/watson-co-scientist.git
cd watson-co-scientist

# Create and activate a conda environment
conda create -n co_scientist python=3.11
conda activate co_scientist

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Azure OpenAI (default provider)
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-05-15
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment_name

# OpenAI (fallback)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Web Search (optional)
BING_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_bing_search_api_key
```

Note: The environment variable names have been updated to match Azure OpenAI's standard naming conventions.

### Configuration

The system uses a configuration file to manage settings for models and agents. A template is provided in `config/template.json`. If you want to customize the configuration:

1. Copy `config/template.json` to `config/default.json` (this file is git-ignored)
2. Edit the settings as needed

The system will automatically load configuration from environment variables, so you typically don't need to modify the config file unless you want to change model settings, agent prompts, or other parameters.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI provides an interactive interface to work with the system directly:

```bash
# Start the interactive CLI
python main.py

# Analyze a specific research goal
python main.py --research_goal "Investigate the molecular mechanisms of protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases."

# Use a specific configuration
python main.py --config custom_config
```

#### Interactive Mode Commands

When running in interactive mode, you can use the following commands:

- `goal: <text>` - Set a new research goal
- `run` - Run 1 iteration
- `run <N>` - Run N iterations
- `state` - Print the current system state
- `overview` - Generate and print a research overview
- `protocols` - Show generated experimental protocols
- `generate-protocol` - Generate an experimental protocol for a top hypothesis
- `search: <query>` - Search scientific databases across domains
- `synthesize: <query>` - Synthesize knowledge across multiple scientific domains
- `help` - Show help information
- `exit` or `quit` - Exit the program
