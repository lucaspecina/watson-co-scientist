Introduction
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor
neurons, leading to progressive muscle weakness, paralysis, and ultimately death. While the exact cause of ALS remains
unknown, a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and age-related cellular changes is
believed to contribute to its pathogenesis. ...
Recent findings and related research
Recent research has implicated several key players and processes in ALS. TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein, is found
mislocalized and aggregated in the cytoplasm of affected neurons in the majority of ALS cases. This protein’s ability
to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has come under intense scrutiny, with evidence suggesting that
dysregulation of this process leads to the formation of pathological aggregates. Further, impairments in nucleocytoplasmic
transport, the process by which molecules move between the nucleus and cytoplasm, have been observed in ALS and
linked to TDP-43 pathology. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a cellular response to protein misfolding, has also been
implicated as a potential contributing factor.
Hypothesis
Cellular stress (including but not limited to ER stress) induces post-translational modifications (PTMs) on
specific FG-Nups (focusing initially on Nup98 and Nup62) at the nuclear pore complex (NPC). These Nup
PTMs modify the interaction between these Nups and TDP-43, leading to altered TDP-43 dynamics and increased
retention at the NPC. This increased retention at the NPC, in turn, triggers the disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport.
Rationale and specificity
Instead of making the hypothesis about LLPS, we are making it much more specific but with the same starting point.
Cellular stress, a broad concept encompassing various cellular insults, can trigger a cascade of molecular events. A key
consequence of stress response is altered protein structure and function, which can be mediated by PTMs. Nuclear pore
proteins, particularly FG-Nups like Nup98 and Nup62, form a "hydrogel" or selective barrier at the NPC, regulating the
movement of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We hypothesize that specific PTMs on these FG-Nups
(e.g., phosphorylation, O-GlcNAcylation initially) directly alter their interaction with TDP-43. TDP-43, known to
interact with the NPC and be involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, may get inappropriately trapped or retained at
the NPC when interacting with PTM-modified Nups. This trapping alters TDP-43 dynamics (even if not disrupting
LLPS directly initially), meaning it cannot perform its normal functions and disrupting nucleocytoplasmic transport,
which we know is happening in ALS. Since even a small change in transport could lead to downstream problems,
this is a plausible initial event with testable consequences. The specific FG-Nups (Nup98/62) and chosen PTMs
(phosphorylation/O-GlcNAcylation) provide a concrete starting point for experimentation. This mechanism directly
links cellular stress to TDP-43 dysfunction and the key ALS pathology of defective nucleocytoplasmic transport by
invoking a novel interaction mechanism at the NPC – all testable in vitro.
Experimental design and validation
Cell Types: Human iPSC-derived motor neurons from healthy controls and ALS patients. Stress Induction: Induce
cellular stress using established pharmacological agents (e.g., tunicamycin for ER stress, arsenite for oxidative stress,
oligomycin A for mitochondrial stress) and physical stressors (heat shock). Test different stressors individually and in
combination. This broadened approach allows for a more robust investigation of the stress response.
Nup PTM Analysis: Assess PTMs of Nup98 and Nup62 specifically using mass spectrometry and immunoblotting
with PTM-specific antibodies (specifically looking for phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation). Focus the analysis on
these two.

Aspects already explored:
• TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation in ALS: Extensively documented in multiple abstracts [1, 3, 4, 5, 6].
• Nucleocytoplasmic transport defects in ALS: Demonstrated in connection with TDP-43 pathology and C9orf72
mutations [4, 5, 6].
• NPC disruption in neurodegenerative diseases: Identified in ALS/FTD, Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and others,
suggesting a common mechanism [4, 5, 7, 8].
• The link between cellular stress and TDP-43 pathology: Explored in the context of stress granule formation and
TDP-43 aggregation [5]. Note - stress is explored in general, but the idea of it leading to PTMs of Nups is new.
• Role of FG-Nups in NPC function: FG-Nups are known to form a selective barrier regulating transport, but the
impact of their PTMs on TDP-43 interaction in ALS is novel [7].
• The implication of PTMs for TDP-43: TDP-43 PTMs are widely researched, especially phosphorylation and
ubiquitination. However, our hypothesis doesn’t speak about TDP-43 PTMs, it is about Nup PTMs [1, 3, 4].
Novel Aspects:
• Cellular stress as an initiator of Nup PTMs: While stress is linked to TDP-43 pathology, the idea that it triggers
specific PTMs on Nups (Nup98/Nup62) as an initiating event in ALS is novel, especially that these PTMs are
phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation.
• Nup PTMs (phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation specifically) altering TDP-43 interaction at the NPC: The
hypothesis proposes a novel mechanism where stress-induced PTMs on specific Nups (Nup98/Nup62) directly
modify their interaction with TDP-43. This hasn’t been explored before, particularly the focus on these specific
PTMs and Nups.
• TDP-43 retention at the NPC as a key event: Instead of focusing on LLPS or aggregation directly, the hypothesis
suggests that altered TDP-43 dynamics, specifically increased retention at the NPC due to modified Nup
interactions, are a triggering factor. This specific mechanism at the NPC disrupting nucleocytoplasmic transport
is novel.
• Focus on early events and potential for therapeutic intervention: By pinpointing early molecular events (Nup
PTMs, altered TDP-43-Nup interaction), the hypothesis opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention targeting
these specific processes, potentially before irreversible damage occurs.
• Broadening stress beyond ER stress: It is novel to consider multiple stressors in combination and it broadens the
idea beyond ER stress (as suggested in the original provided idea).



#### Example output of review critiques by the Reflection agent
• Lack of strong justification for motor neuron specificity: The initial hypothesis lacked a strong explanation for
why the proposed mechanism would predominantly affect motor neurons, a critical aspect of ALS pathology.
• Limited exploration of downstream consequences: While the idea connects to nucleocytoplasmic transport defects,
it doesn’t fully elaborate on how these defects lead to other ALS-related pathologies like TDP-43 aggregation or
RNA processing defects.
• Potential technical challenges: Identifying the specific PTMs responsible and demonstrating their direct impact
on TDP-43 retention and transport might be technically difficult.
• Narrow focus on specific Nups and PTMs: Initially focusing only on Nup98/Nup62 and two types of PTMs
(phosphorylation, O-GlcNAcylation) could be too restrictive, potentially overlooking other important factors.
• Less holistic approach: The focus on a specific mechanism at the NPC might neglect broader cellular processes
involved in ALS pathogenesis.
• The temporal relationship with TDP-43 pathology is not clear: It’s not clear whether the hypothesized mechanism
occurs before or after other ALS hallmarks like cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregation, which is crucial for establishing
causality.

Assumptions of the Idea:
• Cellular stress induces PTMs on Nup98 and Nup62: The hypothesis assumes that various forms of cellular stress
can trigger specific PTMs (phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation) on Nup98 and Nup62.
• PTMs on Nup98/Nup62 alter their interaction with TDP-43: It’s assumed that these specific PTMs directly
modify the binding affinity or interaction dynamics between Nup98/Nup62 and TDP-43 at the NPC.
• Altered Nup-TDP-43 interaction leads to increased TDP-43 retention at the NPC: This assumption posits that
the modified interaction results in TDP-43 being trapped or retained at the NPC for longer durations.
• Increased TDP-43 retention at the NPC disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport: The hypothesis assumes that this
prolonged retention of TDP-43 at the NPC interferes with the normal transport of other molecules across the
nuclear envelope.
• Nucleocytoplasmic transport defects contribute to ALS pathology: The idea assumes that the resulting NCT
disruption is a significant contributor to the downstream pathological events in ALS, such as motor neuron
degeneration.
• Motor neurons are more susceptible to this mechanism: It’s assumed that motor neurons are particularly vulnerable
to this stress-induced, Nup-mediated TDP-43 retention and subsequent NCT defects compared to other cell types.
Reasoning about assumptions:
• Cellular stress induces PTMs on Nup98 and Nup62: This is plausible. Cellular stress is known to activate various
signaling pathways that can lead to PTMs on numerous proteins. Nups, being long-lived proteins, are susceptible
to modifications. However, whether Nup98 and Nup62 are specifically targeted by stress-induced phosphorylation
and O-GlcNAcylation needs experimental verification.
• PTMs on Nup98/Nup62 alter their interaction with TDP-43: This is possible but requires experimental validation.
PTMs can significantly alter protein-protein interactions by changing surface charge, conformation, or binding
sites. While there’s no direct evidence for this specific interaction, it’s a reasonable hypothesis given the role of
FG-Nups in interacting with transport factors.
• Nucleocytoplasmic transport defects contribute to ALS pathology: This is supported by existing literature [4, 5].
NCT defects have been observed in ALS and are thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. However, whether
this specific mechanism is a primary driver or a downstream consequence needs further investigation.
• Motor neurons are more susceptible to this mechanism: This is a crucial assumption but lacks strong justification
in the current proposal. Motor neurons have unique characteristics (high metabolic demand, long axons) that
might make them more vulnerable to stress and NCT defects. However, this needs to be explicitly tested by
comparing motor neurons to other cell types.

1. Cellular stress induces PTMs like phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation.
Cellular stress encompasses a range of conditions that disrupt cellular homeostasis, including nutrient deprivation,
hypoxia, oxidative stress, and the accumulation of misfolded proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central
organelle involved in protein synthesis, folding, and modification. When the ER’s capacity to handle protein folding
is overwhelmed, a condition known as ER stress arises. This triggers a signaling pathway called the unfolded protein
response (UPR) aimed at restoring ER homeostasis.
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are covalent modifications to proteins that occur after translation. They play
crucial roles in regulating protein function, localization, and interactions. Phosphorylation, the addition of a phosphate
group, and O-GlcNAcylation, the addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, are two common PTMs.
Numerous studies have demonstrated a strong link between cellular stress, including ER stress, and the alteration of
PTMs. Here’s a breakdown:
• ER Stress and Phosphorylation: The UPR, activated during ER stress, involves multiple signaling pathways, many of which rely on phosphorylation. For example, PERK (PKR-like ER kinase), a key UPR sensor,
undergoes autophosphorylation upon sensing misfolded proteins. This activated PERK then phosphorylates
eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha), leading to a global attenuation of translation. Another UPR sensor,
IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1), possesses both kinase and endoribonuclease activity. Upon activation, IRE1
autophosphorylates and splices XBP1 mRNA, leading to the production of a transcription factor that upregulates
chaperones and other proteins involved in protein folding and degradation. These are just two examples; numerous
other proteins are phosphorylated during ER stress, affecting various cellular processes.
• ER Stress and O-GlcNAcylation: O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic PTM influenced by nutrient availability
and cellular stress. Evidence suggests a complex interplay between ER stress and O-GlcNAcylation. Some
studies report increased O-GlcNAcylation during ER stress, potentially as a protective mechanism. For example,
O-GlcNAcylation of certain chaperones can enhance their activity and promote protein folding. Conversely, other
studies suggest that ER stress can lead to decreased O-GlcNAcylation. The exact relationship likely depends on
the specific stress conditions, cell type, and the targeted proteins.
• Cellular Stress (beyond ER Stress) and PTMs: Other forms of cellular stress also impact PTMs. Oxidative
stress, for example, can lead to protein oxidation, which can affect protein function and stability. Nutrient
deprivation can alter the availability of substrates for PTMs, such as UDP-GlcNAc for O-GlcNAcylation. Hypoxia
can also induce changes in phosphorylation and other PTMs, influencing cellular responses to low oxygen levels.
In summary, the available evidence strongly supports the assertion that cellular stress, including ER stress, can induce
PTMs like phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation on proteins. This effect is mediated by complex signaling pathways
and serves to regulate various cellular processes in response to stress.

[Output]
Question: Sufficiency of CXCR1/2 Inhibition: What is the rationale for assuming that CXCR1/2 inhibition *alone*
will be sufficient to overcome the established heterogeneity and multiple compensatory pathways known to drive AML
progression and resistance, *even before* considering combination therapies?
This challenges the fundamental assumption that targeting a single pathway (even a dual-target one) will be effective in
a complex disease like AML. AML is known for its ability to bypass single-target inhibition. Addressing this upfront is
crucial to justify the entire approach, especially before investing heavily in combination studies.
Answer: The rationale for initially focusing on CXCR1/2 inhibition with Reparixin, before immediately jumping to
combinations, stems from several interwoven, but not entirely definitive, points:
• Targeting a Key TME Node: CXCR1/2 are major regulators of neutrophil and myeloid-derived suppressor
cell (MDSC) recruitment to the tumor microenvironment. These cells, in turn, contribute significantly to immune
suppression, angiogenesis, and therapy resistance in AML. By blocking these receptors, Reparixin aims to disrupt
a central hub of TME-mediated support for AML cells. The idea is not necessarily that CXCR1/2 inhibition is
sufficient in all cases, but that it addresses a significant and often overlooked contributor to AML progression.
• Dual Receptor Blockade: Reparixin’s dual inhibition of CXCR1 and CXCR2 is hypothesized to be more
effective than targeting either receptor individually. While not explicitly stated in the provided text, there could
be redundancy or synergy between these two receptors in promoting AML progression. Blocking both might offer
a more substantial impact on the TME than single-receptor antagonists.
• Establishing a Baseline: The proposal, while acknowledging the complexity of AML, strategically starts with
single-agent Reparixin to establish a clear baseline of its activity and effects. This is crucial for several reasons:
– Understanding Single-Agent Effects: It’s essential to dissect the specific contributions of Reparixin alone
before introducing the complexity of combinations. This allows for a more rational design of combination
strategies.
– Identifying Resistance Mechanisms: Studying single-agent resistance is simpler and more direct than
untangling resistance mechanisms in a multi-drug scenario. The extensive resistance studies proposed are
specifically geared towards understanding Reparixin-specific resistance.
– Patient Stratification: The comprehensive patient stratification plan is designed to identify patients who
might respond to Reparixin as a single agent, or for whom it forms a critical foundation for combination
therapy.
• TME Reprogramming, Not Just Cytotoxicity: The proposal positions Reparixin not just as a cytotoxic
agent, but as a TME modulator. The hypothesis is that by altering the TME, Reparixin may sensitize AML cells
to other therapies or even trigger immune-mediated clearance. This "reprogramming" effect might not be fully
captured by traditional cytotoxicity assays alone.
• Sequential therapy: The proposal includes sequential administration of drugs, where Reparixin can prime the
tumor cells for killing and/or resensitize them too.
Reasoning: The idea isn’t incoherent, but it requires careful consideration of the sufficiency assumption. While the
points above provide a rationale, they don’t guarantee that CXCR1/2 inhibition alone will be sufficient in all, or even
most, cases of AML. The heterogeneity of AML, with its multitude of driver mutations and compensatory pathways,
strongly suggests that combination therapies will ultimately be necessary for many patients.
The strength of the proposal lies in its methodical approach. It doesn’t claim that Reparixin is a magic bullet. It sets
out to systematically investigate its potential, both alone and in combination, and to identify the specific patient subsets
most likely to benefit. The extensive in vivo and patient stratification studies are key to addressing the "sufficiency"
question empirically. The proposal is essentially a very detailed roadmap for determining when and how CXCR1/2
inhibition can be most effectively used in AML treatment, rather than an assertion of universal single-agent efficacy.
Therefore the idea may require combination approaches but the study plan described in the proposal is structured in a
way to determine that.

Unravel a specific and novel molecular mechanism explaining how the same cf-PICI can be found in different bacterial
species.
...
Why can cf-PICIs, but not other types of PICIs or satellites, be easily found in different bacterial species? What is the
mechanism that explains this?
[Output]
The "Modular Capsid-OMV Mediated Transfer" (MCOMT) hypothesis proposes that cf-PICIs achieve their broad host
range through a combination of modular capsid interactions and OMV-mediated transfer, using both tail-dependent and
tail-independent mechanisms. Several observations support this hypothesis:
• Widespread presence of PICIs in Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Enterobacteriaceae and Pastuerellaceae:
These bacteria readily produce and internalize OMVs, aligning with the MCOMT hypothesis that OMVs are
crucial for cf-PICI dissemination. The modular capsid, with its broad bacterial surface binding capabilities, further
enhances transfer even without specific tail receptors on target cells.
• Unique PICI att sites not used by temperate prophages: The MCOMT hypothesis, by reducing reliance on helper
phage integration due to OMV-mediated transfer and diverse entry routes, explains the evolution of cf-PICI-specific
att sites independent of phage integration sites. This allows wider integration across bacterial genomes.

#### Example of a scientific debate match in the Ranking agent tournament
Expert 1: I’m intrigued by both ideas, but I have a few clarifying questions. For Idea 1, while the focus on
TDP-43 retention at the NPC is novel, I’m not entirely convinced that it’s fundamentally different from the
extensively studied TDP-43 mislocalization. Could the retention just be a consequence of mislocalization, or are there
experiments that can distinguish these two phenomena? Another question I have: Is there evidence already that specific
PTMs modulate the interaction of Nups and TDP-43? Not necessarily in the context of ALS, but are there any precedents?
Expert 2: For Idea 2, I appreciate the bold approach, but the ISR as a trigger is a significant departure from the
conventional view. Can the proponents of this idea elaborate on the evidence supporting this? Also, what specific lipid
species are they proposing to be most critical at the ER-mitochondria interface and the AIS? Is there any preliminary
reason why those lipids would be disrupted in ALS?
Expert 3: I agree with Expert B regarding the ISR. Shifting it from a response to a trigger is a big claim that needs
strong justification. However, I think there are some initial clues that might be worth investigating. For example, there
are reports that chronic low-level stress responses can actually be detrimental in some contexts. Perhaps a low, persistent
activation of the ISR could predispose cells to damage. This idea needs to be fleshed out though.
...
Expert 3: I also find Idea 1 more compelling at this point. It’s a more focused hypothesis with a clear path for
experimental validation. While Idea 2 is undoubtedly more "outside the box," I’m concerned about the lack of evidence
for the ISR as a trigger and the technical challenges. It feels like a high-risk, high-reward scenario, and given that we can
only choose one, I’d prefer the more grounded approach of Idea 1. I do agree with the idea that the technical challenges
are significant, but I like that the experiments proposed are standard and there are many commercial antibodies available
to start testing this idea.
...
Expert 2: Alright, I’m on board with Idea 1. Let’s focus our efforts on testing this specific mechanism and address the
motor neuron specificity question rigorously in the experimental design. Perhaps by comparing different cell types and
focusing on motor neuron-specific RNAs, as suggested earlier. We should also consider investigating different types of
stress and their combined effects.

#### Example output of a critique by the Meta-review agent
I. Core Hypothesis and Mechanism:
• Primary Driver vs. Consequence: A very common critique across many ideas was the difficulty in proving
that the proposed mechanism is a primary initiating event in ALS rather than a downstream consequence of other
processes. Future ideas need to:
– Provide strong evidence for the temporal sequence of events using longitudinal experiments.
– Employ models where early-stage events can be studied and manipulated.
– Explicitly address whether the proposed mechanism is causative or correlative.
– Specifically knockdown the primary driver to prove it’s necessary and sufficient to cause the pathology.
• Specificity: Many hypotheses were criticized for a lack of specificity in various aspects:
– Molecular Targets: Imprecise identification of specific proteins, RNA species, lipids, PTMs, etc. involved.
Ideas should name specific candidates.
– Cellular Compartments: Vague localization (e.g., "mitochondria" or "AIS"). Ideas should pinpoint
specific subcellular locations whenever possible.
– Disease Mechanisms: Broad terms like "oxidative stress" or "autophagy impairment." Ideas need to
define the precise molecular events involved.
– Types of Stress: If stress is involved, the specific type of stress needs to be defined (e.g., ER stress,
nutrient deprivation, mitochondrial stress, ionic stress).
– Temporality: The timing of the intervention is critical. Early vs. late events, duration of processes, etc.,
should be clearly specified.
• Motor Neuron Specificity: Given the focus on ALS, a strong explanation for why the proposed mechanism
would specifically or preferentially affect motor neurons (and often specific subtypes of motor neurons) is crucial.
Many ideas were critiqued for not adequately addressing this.
• Over-Simplification vs. Complexity: This is a balancing act. Some ideas were criticized for being too
narrowly focused, potentially oversimplifying the complex, multifactorial nature of ALS. Others were criticized for
being overly complex, making them difficult to test and validate experimentally. When in doubt, err on the side
of testability in a reasonable timeframe and budget.
• ALS Subtype Relevance: Ideas should address whether the proposed mechanism is relevant to all ALS subtypes
or specific to certain genetic or sporadic forms. Ideally, address how the proposed work will differentiate or be
applicable to different subtypes.
II. Experimental Design and Feasibility:
• Model System Limitations: Reviewers frequently pointed out the limitations of in vitro models, particularly
iPSC-derived motor neurons. While valuable, these models may not fully capture the in vivo environment, cell-cell
interactions, or the aging process. Future ideas need to:
– Acknowledge the limitations of the chosen model system.
– Propose validation in multiple model systems if possible, including eventually animal, ex-vivo and, if
applicable, in-vivo models.
– Carefully consider and justify the choice of control cell types.
– Propose isogenic controls where relevant.
• Technical Challenges: Many ideas proposed experiments that are technically very challenging. Reviewers often
raised concerns about feasibility and the potential for ambiguous results. Future ideas should:
– Demonstrate awareness of the technical hurdles.
– Propose realistic solutions and alternative approaches.
– Prioritize experiments that are most likely to yield clear, interpretable data.
• Specificity of Tools: When using inhibitors, antibodies, or other tools, their specificity needs to be carefully
considered and validated to avoid off-target effects that can confound results. Appropriate controls and validation
experiments must be included.
• Quantitative Rigor: Many critiques centered on the need for more rigorous quantification of experimental
results. Future ideas need to:
– Clearly define measurable outcomes.
– Describe the specific assays and techniques that will be used for quantification.
– Include appropriate statistical analysis plans.
– Have a proposed plan for controls, replicates, and sample sizes


#### Example output of a critique by the Meta-review agent (continued)
• Time-Course Experiments: Given the dynamic nature of cellular processes, incorporating time-course experiments is often crucial to understanding the sequence of events and demonstrating causality.
• Distinguishing Cause from Effect: This requires careful experimental design, including:
– Longitudinal studies to observe the temporal order of events.
– Intervention experiments to manipulate the proposed cause and observe the effects downstream.
– Temporal resolution to demonstrate that the potential cause occurs before a downstream event.
III. Novelty and Impact:
• Incremental vs. Groundbreaking: Many ideas were criticized for being incrementally novel, building upon
existing knowledge rather than proposing truly groundbreaking mechanisms.
• "Key Switch" Claims: Several ideas were criticized for prematurely claiming that the proposed mechanism is
the "key switch" for ALS. This type of strong claim requires very strong supporting evidence. It is often better to
frame the hypothesis in terms of a significant contributing factor and test its requirement for the pathology.
• Therapeutic Potential: While not always explicitly stated, the potential for translating the findings into
therapeutic strategies is an important consideration. Ideas that offer a clear path toward therapeutic development
may be viewed more favorably, provided a strong rationale is presented for the specific therapeutic approach.
IV. Assumptions and Validation:
• Strong Assumptions: Many hypotheses rely on strong assumptions that lack direct experimental support.
Future ideas need to:
– Clearly state all assumptions.
– Provide a strong rationale for each assumption, citing relevant literature.
– Propose experiments to directly test the most critical assumptions.
• Validation of Assumptions:
– Reviewers consistently emphasized the need for rigorous experimental validation of all assumptions.
– Assumptions should be addressed in the order of the proposed mechanism.
– If the initial steps are not validated, it may be unnecessary to proceed to later steps.
V. General Advice Based on Common Critiques:
• Mechanistic Detail: Provide as much specific mechanistic detail as possible. Don’t just state that pathway X is
affected; describe how it is affected at the molecular level.
• Literature Review: Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the existing literature, including contradictory
findings. Address how the proposed idea fits into the current understanding of ALS and how it differs from
previous work.
• Focus on Causality: Always design experiments that can distinguish between cause and effect.
• Feasibility: Prioritize experiments that are feasible with available resources and expertise. Consider using a
phased experimental approach. Prioritize the experiments used to validate assumptions in the order they appear
in the proposed mechanism.
• Strong Rationale: Provide a clear and compelling rationale for every aspect of the hypothesis and experimental
design.
• Specificity of Controls: Explain why the choices of controls used in the experimental design are the best choice
to test the effects of interest. Demonstrate that the effect is not due to a more general effect or mechanism.
• Address Limitations: Acknowledge the limitations of the proposed approach and discuss potential alternative
explanations.
• Quantitative data: Emphasize quantitative data, consider including mathematical modeling of data where
appropriate.

[Main Research Directions]
We will be focusing on these interrelated areas:
• Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress: This direction investigates defects in mitochondrial DNA
repair, mitochondrial dynamics, calcium handling, and oxidative stress response, focusing on their role in initiating
inflammatory signaling and neurodegeneration.
• RNA Processing and Stress Granules: This direction explores abnormalities in RNA processing, transport,
and modification, as well as impaired stress granule dynamics, and their impact on protein homeostasis and
neuronal survival. It includes examining RNA-binding proteins, RNA structure and modifications, translation
defects, and the interplay between RNA and proteostatic stress responses.
• Protein Homeostasis and the Nucleocytoplasmic Transport: This direction is aimed at investigating
defects in protein folding, trafficking, aggregation, and degradation, as well as nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT)
dysfunction, with a particular focus on the nuclear pore complex (NPC). This includes how those pathways and
processes influence, and are influenced by, TDP-43 and FUS protein function and localization.
• ...
Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress
• Rationale: Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are consistently implicated in ALS pathogenesis.
Mitochondria are critical for cellular energy production, and their dysfunction can lead to a cascade of events
including increased oxidative stress, impaired calcium handling, inflammation, and ultimately cell death. Given
the high energy requirements of motor neurons, especially upper motor neurons, these deficits are expected to have
a significant impact. We hypothesize that specific mitochondrial vulnerabilities, not just generalized dysfunction
play a very early role in initiating disease and provide a specific cellular event which can be targeted for research
and for potential future therapy.
• Recent Findings: Research has shown that mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance genes are
associated with ALS. Further there are links between impaired mitochondrial calcium handling and oxidative
stress, with a particular focus on base excision repair (BER) pathway defects and a potential link to activation
of the cGAS-STING pathway. These findings suggest that a deeper understanding of mtDNA integrity, repair
mechanisms, and ROS dynamics is critical for uncovering the initial drivers of ALS.
• Areas of Research:
– Mitochondrial DNA Repair Defects:
∗ Why Research? Explore the possibility that a deficiency in base excision repair (BER) enzymes for
mitochondrial DNA is a primary driver of ALS.
∗ What to Research? Investigate the activity and expression of specific BER enzymes (e.g., OGG1) in
iPSC-derived motor neurons from ALS patients and controls. Assess whether deficiencies correlate
with increased accumulation of oxidized mtDNA lesions (e.g., 8-oxo-dG) and whether these can be
released into the cytoplasm after VDAC or MOMP activation. Determine if this release activates the
cGAS-STING pathway.
∗ Example Idea: Measure OGG1 enzyme activity, oxidized mtDNA levels (8-oxo-dG) and cGAS-STING
activation in iPSC-derived motor neurons. Genetically manipulate (knock-out/overexpress) key components of the mitochondrial BER pathway or target specific pathways using small molecules. Use
VDAC inhibitors to prevent release or modulate MOMP function to understand cause and effect of
ox-mtDNA release and cGAS-STING activation on cell death and inflammatory outcomes.
– Mitochondrial Calcium Handling and Oxidative Stress:
∗ Why Research? Motor neurons have high calcium demands and are sensitive to oxidative damage.
Imbalances in mitochondrial calcium handling and ROS production may trigger a cascade leading to
neurodegeneration.
∗ What to Research? Examine the role of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and other calcium
transporters in ALS. Assess if dysregulated calcium influx into mitochondria leads to increased ROS
production and whether this is different in different types of motor neurons. Study the potential role
of calcium handling defects as a primary trigger or modifier of the disease.
∗ Example Idea: Use calcium indicators and ROS sensors in iPSC-derived motor neurons to monitor
real-time calcium and ROS levels in mitochondria. Manipulate mitochondrial calcium uptake via
pharmacological or genetic approaches (e.g., MCU inhibitors or knock-outs). Assess cell survival and
the impact on inflammatory response markers and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway to assess
direct causality.

Protein Homeostasis and the Nucleocytoplasmic Transport:
• Rationale: The proper folding, trafficking, degradation, and localization of proteins are critical for cellular
function. Defects in these processes can lead to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, disrupt cellular
signaling, and initiate pathways leading to cell death in ALS. The nucleus is a key compartment, and transport
into and out of this organelle is essential for cellular function.
• Recent Findings: Research has identified misfolded TDP-43 and FUS as key pathological features of ALS.
Furthermore, the dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a
recurring feature, with recent findings that emphasize defects in early stages of assembly and dynamic function of
the NPC as an early initiating step.
• Areas of Research:
– Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) Dysfunction:
∗ Why Research? The UPS is a major cellular protein degradation machinery. Defects in the UPS can
lead to an accumulation of misfolded proteins, which could lead to cellular stress and death. Exploring
the potential of a functional deficiency in these system as an early trigger in disease.
∗ What to Research: Investigate how UPS functionality is altered in ALS models, with particular attention
to the role of E3 ligases in TDP-43 and FUS degradation. Determine whether specific modifications on
ALS related proteins impair their degradation and whether specific pathways of protein quality control
are affected in early stages of the disease. Assess if this is a primary cause or secondary outcome of
other disease related pathways.
∗ Example Idea: Use cell-based assays to measure UPS activity and substrate degradation rates in
iPSC-derived motor neurons. Conduct proteomic analysis to identify specific ubiquitinated proteins
that accumulate in ALS cells. Genetically manipulate UPS components or use small molecules to
modulate their function and assess cellular responses (e.g. measuring protein aggregation and cell
survival)
– Autophagy Dysfunction:
∗ Why Research? Autophagy is crucial for clearing cellular debris and aggregates. Dysfunctional
autophagy can lead to the accumulation of toxic proteins and can lead to organelle defects.
∗ What to Research? Explore how autophagy pathways are altered in ALS, focusing on the specific
mechanisms of cargo recognition, autophagosome formation, and lysosome fusion. Assess if specific
types of autophagy including mitophagy (mitochondrial specific) or lipophagy (lipid specific) are more
vulnerable in specific cell types.
∗ Example Idea: Track the formation and degradation of autophagosomes in real-time in hiPSC-derived
motor neurons after different stress conditions. Manipulate key effectors of the autophagy pathway
and observe cellular response, measuring protein aggregation, cell viability and inflammatory markers.
