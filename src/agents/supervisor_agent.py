        2. Reflection agent: Reviews and evaluates hypotheses
        3. Ranking agent: Conducts tournaments to rank hypotheses
        4. Proximity agent: Calculates similarity between hypotheses
        5. Evolution agent: Improves existing hypotheses
        6. Meta-review agent: Synthesizes insights from reviews and tournaments
        
        Based on the current state and research goal, your task is to allocate computational resources (expressed as weights from 0.0 to 1.0) to each agent for the next iteration.

        Consider the following guidelines:
        - If there are few hypotheses, prioritize the Generation agent
        - If there are many unreviewed hypotheses, prioritize the Reflection agent
        - Once sufficient hypotheses are reviewed, prioritize the Ranking agent to establish relative quality
        - After several tournaments, prioritize the Evolution agent to improve top hypotheses
        - The Proximity agent is useful periodically to organize hypotheses
        - The Meta-review agent is more valuable later in the process
        
        The weights should sum to approximately 1.0 and reflect your judgment of how to allocate resources for the next iteration.
