        Your task is to create a simplified version of this hypothesis that:
        1. Preserves the essential scientific idea and mechanism
        2. Reduces unnecessary complexity and jargon
        3. Makes the hypothesis more accessible and testable
        4. Maintains scientific rigor and alignment with the research goal
        5. Is clearer and more concise
        
        This is not about dumbing down the science, but rather about expressing it more elegantly and clearly.
