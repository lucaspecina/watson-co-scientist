Increased ROS levels are detrimental to neuronal health.\n                    - Status: WELL-ESTABLISHED (Confidence: HIGH)\n                    - Justification: High ROS levels are associated with oxidative stress and have been implicated in neuronal cell death.\n                    \n                ### Assumption 2: ROS damages mitochondrial DNA and proteins.\n                **Status: WELL-ESTABLISHED** (Confidence: HIGH)\n                **Central to Hypothesis: Yes**\n                **Causal Role: cause**\n                \n                #### Sub-assumptions:\n                \n                    1. Oxidative stress leads to damage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).\n                    - Status: WELL-ESTABLISHED (Confidence: HIGH)\n                    - Justification: Research shows that ROS can induce mutations in mtDNA, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction.\n                    \n                    2. Mitochondrial protein damage occurs due to oxidative stress.\n                    - Status: WELL-ESTABLISHED (Confidence: HIGH)\n                    - Justification: Oxidative modifications of mitochondrial proteins are documented to impair mitochondrial function.\n                    \n                ### Assumption 3: Mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening occurs following damage.\n                **Status: WELL-ESTABLISHED** (Confidence: HIGH)\n                **Central to Hypothesis: Yes**\n                **Causal Role: mediator**\n                \n                #### Sub-assumptions:\n                \n                    1.

Caspase activation leads to neuronal apoptosis.\n                    - Status: WELL-ESTABLISHED (Confidence: HIGH)\n                    - Justification: Caspases are well-documented mediators of apoptosis in neuronal cells.\n                    \n                ### Assumption 5: Neuronal apoptosis occurs, causing neurodegenerative symptoms.\n                **Status: WELL-ESTABLISHED** (Confidence: HIGH)\n                **Central to Hypothesis: Yes**\n                **Causal Role: effect**\n                \n                #### Sub-assumptions:\n                \n                    1.
