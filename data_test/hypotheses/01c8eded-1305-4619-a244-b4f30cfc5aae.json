  "description": "\n        This hypothesis proposes that initial defects in mitochondrial Complex I activity trigger a series of downstream effects:\n        \n        1. Complex I dysfunction leads to increased ROS production\n        2. ROS damages mitochondrial DNA and proteins\n        3. This leads to mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening\n        4. Cytochrome c is released, activating caspase pathways\n        5. Neuronal apoptosis occurs, causing neurodegenerative symptoms\n        ",
