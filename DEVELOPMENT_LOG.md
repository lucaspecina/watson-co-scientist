# Watson Co-Scientist Development Log

## Project Overview

The Watson Co-Scientist project aims to build an AI system that assists scientists in generating, refining, and testing research hypotheses. As outlined in the [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) file, the system is based on a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the scientific method, enabling collaboration between AI agents and human scientists to accelerate scientific discovery.

## Development Strategy

### Core Architecture Components

1. **Multi-Agent System**:
   - Supervisor Agent: Coordinates specialized agents and manages system resources
   - Generation Agent: Creates novel research hypotheses
   - Reflection Agent: Reviews and evaluates hypotheses
   - Ranking Agent: Conducts tournaments to rank hypotheses via debates
   - Proximity Agent: Calculates similarity between hypotheses
   - Evolution Agent: Improves existing hypotheses
   - Meta-Review Agent: Synthesizes insights from reviews and creates overviews

2. **Flexible Model Integration**:
   - Support for multiple LLM providers (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Ollama)
   - Environment variable configuration for API keys
   - Compatible with different model types and versions

3. **Database Storage**:
   - JSON-based storage for all research artifacts
   - Support for persistence and retrieval of hypotheses, reviews, and other data

4. **Interaction Methods**:
   - Command-line interface
   - API server with RESTful endpoints

## Current Development Status

As of March 7, 2025, we have completed the first iteration of the system with the following components:

1. **Core System Implementation**:
   - Basic system controller with iteration mechanism
   - Configuration management with environment variable support
   - Logging infrastructure
   - Async workflow handling for non-blocking operations

2. **Agent Implementation**:
   - All 7 specialized agents with basic functionality
   - LLM provider interfaces for different model providers (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Ollama)
   - Agent coordination through the Supervisor agent
   - Agent weights for dynamic resource allocation

3. **Data Models**:
   - Models for research goals, hypotheses, reviews, etc.
   - JSON-based database for storing and retrieving data
   - Support for Elo-based tournament ranking

4. **User Interfaces**:
   - Command-line interface for interactive usage with multiple commands
   - API server with RESTful endpoints for system control
   - Swagger UI documentation for API exploration

5. **Security Features**:
   - Environment variable handling for API keys
   - Configuration template without sensitive information
   - Proper gitignore rules to prevent accidental key leaks

## Recent Updates (March 7, 2025)

1. **System Initialization Fixes**:
   - Fixed imports in main.py to correctly import from src module
   - Updated environment variable handling to use Azure OpenAI standard naming conventions
   - Properly handled async functions with asyncio

2. **Configuration Improvements**:
   - Fixed environment variable override in configuration loading
   - Updated template.json to reflect correct field names
   - Fixed issue in OllamaProvider initialization

3. **Documentation Enhancements**:
   - Updated README with comprehensive usage instructions
   - Added detailed examples for both CLI and API interaction
   - Improved environment variable documentation

4. **Testing**:
   - Verified system initialization with API keys
   - Tested API server functionality
   - Ensured proper error handling when keys are missing

## Short-Term Plan (Next 3 Iterations)

1. **Iteration 2: Enhanced Hypothesis Generation**
   - Improve the Generation agent with more advanced techniques
   - Add support for structured scientific literature search
   - Implement better prompting strategies for hypothesis creation

2. **Iteration 3: Advanced Evaluation**
   - Enhance the Reflection agent with deeper scientific verification
   - Improve tournament mechanics in the Ranking agent
   - Add support for user-provided feedback integration

3. **Iteration 4: Hypothesis Evolution & Refinement**
   - Improve the Evolution agent with more sophisticated strategies
   - Add support for experimental protocol generation
   - Enhance the Meta-Review agent's summary capabilities

## Long-Term Plan

1. **Web Interface**
   - Develop a comprehensive web UI for easier interaction
   - Add visualization tools for hypothesis relationships
   - Implement real-time updates and collaboration features

2. **Integration with Scientific Tools**
   - Connect to scientific databases (PubMed, arXiv, etc.)
   - Add support for specialized domain tools (AlphaFold, etc.)
   - Implement data analysis capabilities

3. **Domain Specialization**
   - Create domain-specific configurations for different scientific fields
   - Add specialized agents for domains like biology, chemistry, etc.
   - Develop domain-specific evaluation criteria

4. **Learning & Improvement**
   - Implement mechanisms for the system to learn from past performance
   - Add support for user feedback to improve agent behavior
   - Develop metrics for system evaluation

5. **Collaboration Features**
   - Support for multiple scientists working on the same research goal
   - Hypothesis sharing and collaborative refinement
   - Integration with existing scientific workflows

## Implementation Notes

- Following an iterative development approach, focusing on core functionality first
- Prioritizing modular design for easy extension and modification
- Maintaining strong security practices for API key handling
- Ensuring thorough testing at each development stage
- Documenting all components and design decisions

## Next Steps

1. Further testing of the core system with real research goals
2. Implementing more advanced generation techniques
3. Enhancing the evolution agent capabilities
4. Improving the web search integration (use TAVILY as searcher)

This plan will be updated as development progresses and new insights are gained. The ultimate goal is to create a system that truly assists scientists in accelerating the research process while maintaining scientific rigor and creativity.
