  "title": "Microplastics Modulate Immune Responses via Pattern Recognition Receptors",
  "description": "This hypothesis proposes that microplastics, due to their varying sizes and surface chemistries, may interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on immune cells, altering their activation and response profiles. Specifically, smaller microplastics may be more readily internalized by phagocytic cells, leading to an overactive immune response, while larger particles could induce a different signaling cascade that results in immune tolerance or suppression. This study will aim to characterize the immune response of human macrophages and dendritic cells exposed to different types of microplastics, measuring cytokine production, cell activation markers, and gene expression profiles related to inflammation and immune regulation.",
  "summary": "Microplastics may alter immune responses by interacting with pattern recognition receptors on immune cells, potentially leading to enhanced inflammation or immune suppression.",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    "Immune cells utilize pattern recognition receptors to detect foreign particles, and microplastics can mimic pathogen-associated molecular patterns.",
    "Research indicates that the immune system can respond differently to varying sizes and types of particulate matter."
