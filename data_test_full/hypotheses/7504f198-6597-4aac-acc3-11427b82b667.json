  "title": "Concentration-Dependent Cytotoxicity of Microplastics on Human Cell Lines",
  "description": "This hypothesis suggests that the concentration of microplastics in exposure scenarios correlates with increased cytotoxic effects in human cell lines. High concentrations of microplastics may overwhelm cellular defense mechanisms, leading to increased oxidative stress, apoptosis, and necrosis. By systematically varying the concentration of different types of microplastics in vitro, this study aims to characterize the dose-response relationship and identify thresholds for cytotoxicity. Additionally, it will explore the role of microplastic surface chemistry in mediating cellular interactions and the subsequent health implications.",
  "summary": "Higher concentrations of microplastics may lead to greater cytotoxicity and cellular damage, highlighting the importance of exposure levels in health assessments.",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    "Literature indicates that increased exposure levels to pollutants often correlate with greater cellular toxicity.",
    "Cytotoxic effects of various nanoparticles have been documented, suggesting similar mechanisms may apply to microplastics."
