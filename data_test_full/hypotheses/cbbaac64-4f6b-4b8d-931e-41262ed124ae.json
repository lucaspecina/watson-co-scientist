  "title": "Interference of Microplastic Composition on Cytokine Production in Human Immune Cells",
  "description": "This hypothesis proposes that the chemical composition of microplastics (e.g., polystyrene, polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride) affects the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human immune cells. Different compositions may interact with cellular receptors and signaling pathways, leading to distinct immune responses. By exposing immune cells to microplastics of various compositions and measuring cytokine levels using ELISA and multiplex assays, we can identify specific interactions that mediate immune dysregulation and contribute to health risks associated with microplastic exposure.",
  "summary": "This hypothesis explores how the chemical composition of microplastics influences cytokine production in immune cells, potentially leading to immune dysregulation.",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    "Chemical interactions between nanoparticles and immune cell receptors have been documented.",
    "Cytokine production is a well-established indicator of immune cell activation and inflammation."
