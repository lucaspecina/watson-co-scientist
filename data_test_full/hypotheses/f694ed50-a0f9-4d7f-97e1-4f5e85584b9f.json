  "title": "Microplastic Size-Dependent Modulation of Cellular Autophagy and Immune Response",
  "description": "This hypothesis posits that microplastics of varying sizes (nano, micro, and macro) differentially influence autophagy and immune signaling pathways in human cells. Smaller microplastics may be internalized more readily, leading to an elevated autophagic response as cells attempt to clear out the contaminants. Conversely, larger microplastics may induce a more pronounced inflammatory response due to their inability to be phagocytosed effectively. This differential interaction could elucidate the mechanisms by which microplastics contribute to cellular stress, immune dysregulation, and the potential for chronic inflammatory diseases.",
  "summary": "Microplastics of different sizes may have distinct effects on cellular autophagy and immune responses, suggesting a link between size and health impacts.",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    "Previous studies indicate that particle size influences cellular uptake and immune activation.",
    "Autophagy has been shown to play a crucial role in the clearance of extracellular debris and pathogens."
