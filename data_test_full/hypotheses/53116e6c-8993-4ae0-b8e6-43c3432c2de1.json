  "title": "Microplastics Induce Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Human Cells",
  "description": "This hypothesis posits that exposure to various types of microplastics, particularly those with smaller particle sizes and higher concentrations, leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells. The interaction of microplastics with cellular membranes may disrupt mitochondrial integrity and function, resulting in altered energy metabolism and increased oxidative stress. Additionally, the presence of additives and contaminants associated with microplastics could exacerbate these effects, leading to cellular apoptosis and chronic inflammatory responses. The study will involve exposing human cell lines to different concentrations and sizes of microplastics and measuring mitochondrial activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and apoptosis markers.",
  "summary": "Microplastics may disrupt mitochondrial function in human cells, leading to energy metabolism alterations and increased oxidative stress.",
  "supporting_evidence": [
    "Mitochondria are known to be sensitive to changes in cellular environment, including exposure to foreign particles.",
    "Previous studies have linked oxidative stress to various health problems, suggesting a potential pathway through which microplastics could impact health."
