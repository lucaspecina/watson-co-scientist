  "title": "Microplastic Size-Dependent Disruption of Cellular Ion Homeostasis",
  "description": "This hypothesis posits that the size of microplastics influences their interaction with cellular membranes, leading to alterations in ion homeostasis and cellular signaling pathways. Smaller microplastics may penetrate cells more easily, potentially disrupting ion channels and transporters, leading to an abnormal influx of calcium ions and other critical ions. This dysregulation could trigger stress responses in cells, such as the activation of inflammatory pathways, ultimately affecting immune responses and promoting cell death or dysfunction.",

    "Studies show that nanoparticles can penetrate cellular membranes and disrupt ion channels.",
