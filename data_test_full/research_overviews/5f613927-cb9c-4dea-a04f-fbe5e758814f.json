  "title": "Investigating Microplastics and Their Impact on Human Cellular Health",
  "summary": "This research overview synthesizes emerging hypotheses regarding the potential cellular impacts of microplastics on human health. Recent studies indicate that microplastics, through varying sizes, compositions, and concentrations, may modulate cellular processes and immune responses, leading to chronic health issues. The hypotheses outlined herein provide a framework for understanding these interactions and offer a pathway for developing rigorous experimental methodologies to test their validity. Importantly, the emphasis on verification and causal reasoning is designed to ensure that findings are reliable and applicable to real-world scenarios.",
