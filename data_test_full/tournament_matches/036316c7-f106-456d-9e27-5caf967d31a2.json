  "rationale": "Hypothesis B is superior because it not only addresses the size of microplastics and their effects on a critical immune cell type (macrophages) but also introduces the concept of cellular senescence, which is a more original and novel approach in the context of microplastics and human health. This hypothesis aligns well with the research goal by investigating immune responses and has a clear experimental approach that can be rigorously tested. While Hypothesis A offers sound scientific reasoning, it lacks the originality and specific immune response focus that Hypothesis B provides.",
